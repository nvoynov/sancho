I started programming in the 90s from a programming calculator do-not-remember-the-exact-model and proceed in high school with Turbo Pascal 5.5.

Returned to programming in the late 2000s in the last courses of the university and developed my first products. The first one was a small managing accounting software for a small trading enterprise, the second was the dean's office of my faculty for managing information about faculty students. Both were client-server apps written with Delphi 5, stored data in the Firebird Database, and provided customizable reports on FastReport. The first app was in production for about 10 years, the second was still used up to the end of 2022.

After graduating from university, I got my first job as a Delphi programmer, doing the same as for my first applications, and freelancing on user support of the FibPlus Delphi components for direct access to the Interbase/Firebird.

First time I got my first Business Analyst position in 2006, and there I got a glimpse of Software Requirements and design my first IS that even won sort of ministry of ecology competition. But then I again returned to accounting software helping my university mates with implementing, maintaining, evolving, and supporting users of managing accounting systems based on 1Cv8.

Since 2011 I was Business/Systems Analysis. In the beginning, it was a BigKnowCo where I was playing a vague role of Software Engineer and mainly worked on requirements specifications and architecture design documents for a telecom provider; a bit of requirement re-engineering based on source code of inherited systems, and a bit of true re-engineering.

Then I proceed to a small but very ambitious company, again playing for Business/Systems Analyst and casually for Product Owner. I met there the most exciting people, and projects.

In 2021 I felt that playing Business Analyst last ten years, I lost the reality of modern software design and construction. And to dispel that feeling I took some time off to spend on distributed systems, event-sourcing, CQRS, Clean Architecture, and sort of subjects; advanced in Ruby, and designed a few open-source tools.
