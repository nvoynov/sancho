title: What I can help you with
...

That sounds impressive although does not say anything "_There are tree steps towards a good software product - Right Product, Done Right, Managed Right_." And I'm here to help you with the second step.

I can help you with back-end layer implementation. Having requirements, I  _Do It Right_ designing your app in accordance with The Clean Architecture principles and shipping the result in Docker container. You'll get clean and clear:

- single business logic layer;
- one or more interface layers;
- one or more "tech" plugins.

> I can also help you with defining _The Right Product_ through discovery phase and requirements design, deliverables suitable for estimations by software developer suppliers.

I speed up my development flow with [Punch](https://github.com/nvoynov/punch) - my own code generator. That focus me on important thing and eliminate some necessary but boring manual work. You can read more about the flow [here](done-right.html)

_Speaking for MVP_ when all or some plugins could be simplified for the schedule, I can give it to you blazingly fast. An average domain with a few entities and dozen of services (maybe simple users or orders management service) will cost you 40-50 hours. And it will be _fully tested_, _open to add by new "faces"_ (web/API, message queue), will have _the ability to switch between plugins_ (SQL, NoSQL, InMemoryStore.) You can see some examples of such results [here](punch_orders).
