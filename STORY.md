Exercising with [Punch](https://github.com/nvoynov/punch) and inspired by the result I decided to propose my private "clean domain development" services. Having written some content drafts, my first thought was to just use Jekyll as it is on nvoynov.github.io, but have searched a bit through the Internet I bumped into [zenweb](https://github.com/seattlerb/zenweb) and decided to give it a try.

Fortunately, something went wrong :) and a few of my content pages, despite all my dancing with a tambourine, just failed to translate into HTML. Being looking through `zenweb` code I realized that it's actually easy to design on my own.

So meet the Sancho :)
